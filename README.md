# TwitchWatchList
Always have a list of your favorite online Twitch streamers ready with one click in your browser.

# Project Goal
Create a Chrome Extension that alerts the user when a channel on the list goes online.

# How to install extension to test
1. Visit chrome://extensions and activate "Developer mode".
2. Click "Load unpacked extension..." and select the folder of the project.

Alternatively, you can drag and drop the directory where your extension files live onto chrome://extensions in your browser to load it.

If the extension is valid, it'll be loaded up and active right away! If it's invalid, an error message will be displayed at the top of the page. Correct the error, and try again.
